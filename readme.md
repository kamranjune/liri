liri.js

I got all 4 commands working in the nick of time.  There were so many little bugs to be fixed. 

You run node liri.js followed by the following screen shots corresponding to the 4 bands, spotify, movie, and do-what-it-says commands respectively:

(two words)

node movie-this braveheart

node do-what-it-says

And I added it to my portfolio.


Quite a challenge in a short period of time with a lot of other things going on.
